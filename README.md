# Recipe-Recommender-Assignment-EDA
Objective is to design a recommender system to recommend recipes to users based on their choice and the current recipe they are looking at.
Here, we are not designing a recommender engine from scratch. Instead, we are using the cleaned data provided by UpGrad
Also, assignment is just about to explore the data and create features that can be used to build the recommender.
